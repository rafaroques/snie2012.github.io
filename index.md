My name is Shaoliang Nie. I am PhD candidate in the Computer Science department at <a href="https://www.csc.ncsu.edu">North Carolina State University</a>. My advisor is <a href="https://www.csc2.ncsu.edu/faculty/healey/">Christopher Healey</a>. My current research focuses on visual analytics solutions to understand deep learning models.

I have strong interests in learning, understanding and creating. I believe that in order to learn, understand or create, we need to know about how we learn, understand and create. One prominent element enabling these capacities is the [cognitive medium](http://cognitivemedium.com) available. While visualization is widely used as an approach to explore and discover patterns from large dataset, it can also be seen as a congitive medium that auguments human intelligence by combining the power of human brain and technology. Studying learning, understanding and creating also has a reciprocal relationship with artificial intelligence. Knowledge of how the brain works inspires new AI paradigms and knowledge of AI models sheds lights on how the brain works.
