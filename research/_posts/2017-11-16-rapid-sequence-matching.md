title: Rapid Sequence Matching for Visualization Recommender Systems
purl: 
---

* Adapted and implemented [locality sensitive hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing) for rapid visualization matching
* Proposed a representation of visualizations as set notations, applied [MinHash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinHash) and locality sensitive hashing for rapid matching and proposed multiple metrics to rank recommendations based on the sequence graph
* Achieved **constant time performance** with high accuracy on simulated large databases
* Implemented with Java and [Neo4j](http://neo4j.com)
* Paper submitted to [KDD 2018](http://www.kdd.org/kdd2018/)
