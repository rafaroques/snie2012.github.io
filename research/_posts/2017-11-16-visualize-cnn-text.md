title: Visualizing Convolutional Neural Networks for Text Analytics  
purl: 
---

* Designed and implemented a novel **interactive visualization system** to study of the internal mechanisms of CNNs in the text domain
* Integrated multiple visualization paradigms, proposed a novel **aggregated animation** to expose patterns and a novel visual design for large networks
* Supported **instance- and subset-based analysis** and comparison
* Scaled to large networks by **clustering, compression** and **summarization**
* Revealed multiple patterns that facilitated deep learning researchers to understand and improve the performance of multiple **part-of-speech classification models**
* Implemented with [d3](https://d3js.org), [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org)
