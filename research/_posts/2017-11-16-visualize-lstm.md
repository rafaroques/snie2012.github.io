title: Visualizing Gate Dynamics in Long Short-term Memory Neural Networks (LSTMs) 
purl: 
---

* Designed and implemented a novel **interactive visualization system** to study of the gate dynamics of LSTMs
* Formulated the gate dynamics as multiple **time series** and combined several visual analytical techniques to allow flexible exploration and pattern discovery
* Exposed strong patterns of a stacked two-layer **language model** and confirmed the common belief that LSTMs can selectively carry long-term information
* Implemented with [d3](https://d3js.org), [Babel](https://babeljs.io), [webpack](https://webpack.js.org), [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org)
